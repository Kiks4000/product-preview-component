## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) (JavaScript transpiler)

### Continued development

This project is the first challenge i took on Frontend Mentor. I was given the task to build a product preview card component that would be used in a product preview carousel. 
I decided to use React because it is a popular JavaScript library and it is easy to learn. I also decided to use Vite because it is a JavaScript transpiler that is easy to use.
